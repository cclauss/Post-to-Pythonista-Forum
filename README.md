# Post-to-Pythonista-Forum
Script for posting to the iOS app 'Pythonista' forum from within the app.

#Usage
You can use this as an action extension in Pythonista App. This requires code to be open. When you run it, it will take copy the code you are working on into the post and append/prepend HTML tags to indicate the code. A title is required and please select the right category.

#Please Note
If you modify this code, please do not loop the posting part to the forum.

#Things that are missing/needed:
- error handling for the post request
- a way to have alerts that are from console.alert rather than using UI
- clear post text button?
